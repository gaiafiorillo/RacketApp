## Introduction

The app has two types of users: **bands/artists** and **fans**. Bands can post their concerts, while fans can search for events and save them to their favorites. The app is built using Racket and includes a GUI for easy navigation.

## Features

- **Account Creation:** Users can sign up as either a band or a fan.
- **Concert Listings:** Bands can create, edit, and manage their concert listings.
- **Search Functionality:** Fans can search for concerts by band name or venue.
- **Favorites:** Fans can save concerts to their favorites and remove them later.
- **Concert Availability:** Bands can update concert status (e.g., sold out, canceled).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaiafiorillo/RacketApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
